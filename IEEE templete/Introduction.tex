\section{Introduction}

Increasing of solar PV.

State estimation provides the optimum estimate of power system state based on received measurement units and the knowledge of network modeling. The measurement units may include as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item power injection (real/reactive),
  \item power flow (real/reactive),
  \item bus voltage magnitude,
  \item phase angle,
  \item line current magnitude,
  \item current injection magnitude.
\end{itemize}

In this paper we used Bayesian, SVM techniques to detect invisible solar PV generation.
