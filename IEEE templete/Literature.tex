\section{Literature reviews}

\subsection{Applications of State estimation in power system}
State estimation on distribution power system is reviewed in \cite{b9}.

State Estimation provides various benefits for power system analysis as follows:
\subsubsection{Real time mornitoring} for power system in transmission and distribution levels~\cite{b5}. The Advance Meter infrastructure (AMI) data are fed into SE to real-time mornitor distribution power system in\cite{b7}. It improved the accuracy comparing to pseudo measurment based on historical load.

\subsubsection{Load allocation} in distribution power system. SE assigns active and reactive power values to bus downstream\cite{b6}. Class curves and individual average demand of clients improved accuracy of load allocation\cite{b4}.  The data from AMR system, which are used as the pseudo-measurements, was used to estimate load on the distribution transformers.\cite{b5}.

\subsubsection{Bad data analysis} in several real application, it happens that some flow measurement has no sign or the sign is wrong.
A re-weighting technique was used to reduced the weights association to these measurements\cite{b6}.
It also could helps to treat of power flow with erroneous sign.
Futhurmore, SE was implemented in cyber attack events~\cite{b10} on power system states. A detection false data injection method is proposed in \cite{b8}.

\subsubsection{Topology indentification} the status of branches and switches are indentified in\cite{b6}.


\subsection{previous solar PV detection techniques}
The previous studies has been done on detection of location and estimation of power generation of invisible solar PV sites.
Reference \cite{b11} proposed a change-point detection algorithm for a time series for residential solar PV detection. These method required smart meter data and historical load profile.
The uncertainty of solar PV site and the data generated by a small set of selected representative sites were taken into account to estimates the power gneneration of known solar PV site in~\cite{b12}.  The new hybrid k-means and PCA techniques provided good accuracy of estimating invisible solar PV sites.
The big data characterization of smart grids and two-layer dynamuc optimal synchrophasor measurement devices selection algorithm for fault detection, identification, and causal impact analysis was proposed in~\cite{b13}.
The utility data based on random matrix therory (RMT) are used in detection and estimation of invisible solar PV in real case in China in\cite{b14}.

\subsection{Contributions}
This paper proposed method which identify location and estimation solar PV installation capacity at invisible site.
